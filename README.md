# Happy-Birthday
This is a project used to celebrate a friend's birthday written by C.

Personally speaking, as a beginner in C, I reckon that there are two highlights of this project:  
    1.The usage of multithreading, which enables the program to get password while playing music  
    2.Using the functions **update()** and **gotoxy()** to make the cursor always stay where whe user is inputting string  
  
Undoubtedly, this project is way from perfection, there remains a lot to be improved.  
If you have any good idea, you are welcomed to commit your file!
